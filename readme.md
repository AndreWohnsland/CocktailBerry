This app is used to control a cocktail machine and easily prepare cocktails over a nice-looking user interface. It also offers the option to create and manage your recipes and ingredients over the interface and calculates the possible cocktails to prepare over given ingredients. Track and display cocktail data for different teams to even further increase the fun. Let's get started!

# Features

CocktailBerry can do:

- Prepare cocktails of a given volume and adjusted concentration of alcoholic ingredients
- Add new ingredients and recipes with needed information over the UI
- Specify additional ingredients for later hand add within a recipe (like sticky syrup)
- Define connected ingredients to the machine and also existing additional ingredients over the UI
- Auto calculates and displays possible recipes dependent on given information
- Execute a cleaning program to get rid of remaining fluids
- Export data for later data analysis, send data as mail to a receiver
- Send cocktail production data to a given endpoint, for example a webhook
- Keep track of cocktail count and volume from different teams for some fun competition

In addition, there is the possibility to use and set up a second device as a dashboard:

- Provide the teams API to post and get cocktail data
- Display different modes of data for a by team comparison
- _Optional_: Use the dashboard as WiFi hot-spot


# Quickstart

Here are some simple steps to get CoktailBerry running. You need to have **Python 3.7** or newer and **git** installed.

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreWohnsland/CocktailBerry.git
cd CocktailBerry
pip install -r requirements.txt
# you can get help with python runme.py --help
python runme.py
```

This will start the CocktailBerry program. You may want to run the provided installer script for the RPi instead of pip. See [Installation](https://cocktailberry.readthedocs.io/installation/) for more information.

```bash
sh scripts/setup.sh
```

Now you can [Set Up](https://cocktailberry.readthedocs.io/setup/#setting-up-the-machine-modifying-other-values) your CocktailBerry and tweak the settings to your liking.

# Interface

The interface was programmed with PyQt5 for the users to easily interact with CocktailBerry and enter new ingredients/recipes. There are different views for the tasks.
