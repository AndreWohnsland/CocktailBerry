# Cocktailmaker by Andre Wohnsland

Hello everyone, I am Andre Wohnsland, a German Master Engineer in Renewable Energy Systems, trying to get better in Python every day.\
This is my first published project, a raspberry Pi app for a custom designed Cocktailmaker also created by me.\
I am also planning to do a showcase of the whole machine (it's already running well) but currently i haven't had the time.\
This app is currently under further construction and adding new functionalities, as well as optimising the code (readability and efficiency).\
It also serves to get more used to version control, since it's also my first time using it.\
If you got any questions or proposed improvements, feel free to share and/or contact me.
