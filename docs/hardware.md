# Hardware

You can also run the interface on any non RPi hardware, but you won't be able to control the pins without a device supporting this. To build a functional machine, I provided a list of my used hardware.

## Used Hardware in Showcase Machine

The following component were used within the showcase for the Machine:

- 1x [Raspberry Pi 3b+](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00LPESRUK/) (or newer like [Model 4](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07TD42S27))
- 1x [5-inch Touch Screen](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B071XT9Z7H/) for the Raspberry Pi
- 1x Micro SD-Card (16 Gb is enough)
- 1x 5V Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
- 1x or 2x [Relay-Boards](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07MJF9Z4K) depending on pump count (important to have 5V input control)
- 6-10x Pumps, depending on your setup (you can use a [peristaltic pump](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07YWGSH3C/) or a [membrane pump](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B07L1FB18S/), it should be food save)
- 1x Power supply for the pumps (a 12V/5A Laptop charger in my case, needs to match pump voltage)
- Food safe hose/tubes for the pumps
- Female to Female jumper wires
- Female to Male HDMI and USB extension cable
- Some wires

## Used Hardware in Showcase Teams Dashboard

The following components were used within the showcase for the Teams Dashboard:

- 1x [Raspberry Pi 3b+](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00LPESRUK/) (or newer, like [Model 4](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07TD42S27))
- 1x [7-inch Touch Screen](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B014WKCFR4/)
- 1x [Display Casing](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B01GQFUWIC/)
- 1x Micro SD-Card (16 Gb is enough)
- 1x 5V Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
