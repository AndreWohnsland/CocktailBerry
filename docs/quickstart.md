# Quickstart

Here are some simple steps to get CocktailBerry running. You need to have [**Python 3.7**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer and [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreWohnsland/CocktailBerry.git
cd CocktailBerry
pip install -r requirements.txt
# you can get help with python runme.py --help
python runme.py
```

This will start the CocktailBerry program. You may want to run the provided installer script for the RPi instead of pip. See [Installation](installation.md) for more information.

```bash
sh scripts/setup.sh
```

Now you can [Set Up](setup.md#setting-up-the-machine-modifying-other-values) your CocktailBerry and tweak the settings to your liking.
