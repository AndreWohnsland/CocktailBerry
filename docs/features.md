# Feature Timetable

Here you will find a list of the new features introduced over time.
If you don't find a feature listed in the docs on your CocktailBerry, chances may be that you didn't update for some time.
Cross check your version with the feature list and their according introduction time.
Usually, updating to the lastest version is always a good idea.
