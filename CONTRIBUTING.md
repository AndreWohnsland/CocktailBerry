# Contributing to CocktailBerry

Any input is welcome, whether it is:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with Github

I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints (pylint & autopep8).
6. Issue that pull request!

By submitting code changes to this project, you agree to license your contributions under the same [GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that governs the project.

In short:

- This ensures that the project and its derivatives continue to promote software freedom and openness.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/AndreWohnsland/CocktailBerry/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/AndreWohnsland/CocktailBerry/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626). Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Best way is to use a Python auto formatter within your IDE and an according linting style.

- autopep8 with 120 line length
- pylint for linting and additional formatting
- Try to make the linter 'happy': fix all warnings / errors shown
